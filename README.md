Zie Scherp Hoofdstuk 8 oefening Galgje
(See Sharp Chapter 8 exercise Hangman)

October 2021 I started learning programming C#. I started with self study using the Dutch book 'Zie Scherp' (See Sharp). One of the assignments in the last chapter of was to create a console app of the well known Galgje (hangman) game. Well this is my version. This is one of the first complete C# programs I wrote. I hope you like it!
