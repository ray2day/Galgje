Zie Scherp Hoofdstuk 8 oefening Galgje
(See Sharp Chapter 8 exercise Hangman)

October 2021 I started learning programming C#. I started with self study using the Dutch book 'Zie Scherp' (See Sharp). One of the assignments in the last chapter of was to create a console app of the well known Galgje (hangman) game. Maybe childish to have a code like this on my GitHub, but for me it was a very good exercise to learn the basics and understanding of C# coding. it is one of the first (full) C# programs I wrote. Could it be programmed better?? Ofcourse! But I will not refactor it out of nostalgia. And in a sense of 'When it works... ;-)'I leave it this way. It is a fun game to play. I hope you enjoy it!
